# INamp
AR Indoor Navigation

Adding this project to Unity is pretty easy. Take the zipped folder, and unzip to wherever you’d like. Open Unity, and select “ADD”. 
Select INmap folder from wherever you extracted it to.

This project is for my capstone project at Central Methodist University.
This project is not a completed project. It still needs quite a lot of love. 

The INmap.unitypackage is the package settings and everything you should need to run the project.
